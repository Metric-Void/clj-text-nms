# Player's Guide

This game is based on No Man's Sky, and the winning condition (acquiring **Heart of the Sun**) is actually a main mission 
in the original game called "The Atlas Path".

## Player
The player have the following fields to care about:

- HP: Health Point.
Your health points drops when you've drained your life support, or when encountering bad situations during exploring.
Health can be recovered when you're staying at your base, or when encountering good situations during exploring.

- LS: Life Support.
Your Life Support system will drain over each turn. Life Support drains at different speeds on different planets.
Life Support can be recharged with Oxygen. It'll also slowly recharge when you're at your base.

- Inventory:
Inventory size is not limited. You can view your inventory any time.

- Starship:
The player have one (and only one) starship. You shall use it to travel between planets.
Each flight takes 25% of fuel. The tank can be recharged using Uranium.

- Address Book:
You'll have an address book of your bases and locations you learned during exploration. Yuo'll be able to teleport
to these locations when you're together with your starship.

## Map
Each planet is made up of several regions (or tiles), and the player can travel between tiles by "move"ing.
Different tiles contain different resources, and may have distinct sites to explore. You'll automaticaly perform a scan 
when walking into a new region. Your starship does not follow you when moving.
The planets are not made round, since we can't figure out which way should be south when we're at the north pole.

If you're a hardcore player, it is recommended to draw a map for each of the planets.

## Mining
Mining is the most important method in getting resources. You can mine on any tile, and each tile contains different
resources. Some resources can only be obtained by **"Advaneced Mining Laser"**, which is an essential tool to get 
higher-level resources like gold and silver. These resources are fundamental to winning and you should consider crafting
an advanced mining laser as soon as possible.

If you're on an **exotic** planet, be extremely careful to have an Advanced Mining Laser. Materials on these type of planets
almost certainly require an Advanced Mining Laser.

## Materials
Each planet have a common and a different set of materials.  
These materials can be found on any planet, and can be mined without Advaced Mining Laser:

- Ferrite dust
- Carbon
- Oxygen
- Di-Hydrogen

These materials can be found on any planet, but require Advanced Mining Laser:

- Condensed Carbon
- Copper
- Magnetized Ferrite
- Silicon Powder
- Cobalt
- Gold (Rare)
- Silver (Rare)
- Platinum (Rare)

These materials are specific to planets, and can be mined without advanced mining laser.

- Paraffinium: Confined to "lush" planets.
- Uranium: Confined to "radioactive" planets.
- Ammonium: Confined to "toxic" planets. Can also be found underground.
- CO2: Confined to "cold" planets.
- Sulfur: Confined to "hot" planets.
- Chloride: Confined to planets with water (or other kinds of liquid body).

## Scanning
Scanning a tile will reveal information about the tile and the planet. It'll also tell you whether the **curiousity** you
need to complete this game is found on this tile. If it says "true", you can try getting this artifact by exploring this tile.

## Exploring
Exploring a region may give you 

## Crafting:
Crafting is the central part of the game. Many items can be obtained (or can only be obtained) by crafting.

Here's a list of all crafting recipes.

### Resource Related
- 2 Copper => 1 Chromatic Metal  
- 1 Chromatic Metal => 2 Copper  
- 2 Carbon => 1 Condensed Carbon  
- 1 Condensed Carbon => 2 Carbon  
- 1 Carbon, 2 Oxygen => 1 CO2  
- 2 Ferrite Dust => 1 Magnetized Ferrite  
- 1 Magnetized Ferrite => 2 Ferrite Dust  
- 2 Cobalt => 1 Ionized Cobalt  
- 1 Ionized Cobalt => 2 Cobalt  

### Tools and Machinary
- 50 Carbon => 1 Carbon Nanotube  
- 30 Carbon, 1 Di-Hydrogen Gel => 1 Hermetic Seal  
- 30 Ferrite Dust => 1 Metal Plating  
- 40 Di-Hydrogen => 1 Di-Hydrogen Gel  
- 5 Metal Plating, 2 Carbon Nanotube, 1 Di-Hydrogen Gel => 1 **Advanced mining laser**  

### Heart of the Sun
Items in italics are curiousities found by exploring. These have to be completed in sequence since each step
of the craft requires product from the prior.
